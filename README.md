## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

### What I learned

The positioning of the two circles in the background was more challenging than I thought.

### Continued development

Instead of treating the circles as background images, I think I will try to position them as regular images.
