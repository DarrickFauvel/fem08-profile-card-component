## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Superfast bundling tool

### What I learned

The positioning of the two circles in the background was more challenging than I thought. I used a few media queries at first which were not ideal. But, fellow Frontend Mentor [@hcxweb](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/hcxweb) shared a better solution with me of using background positioning with vw & vh units.
